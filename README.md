# AI and LLM Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects I created to practice working with **artificial intelligence** and **large language models (LLMs)**.

Projects include:
 - Simple chatbot using **OpenAI's API** and **Streamlit** for the interface
 - Text summarization, classification, generation, and sentiment analysis tasks implemented using **HuggingFace transformers**

These projects helped me understand how to integrate **APIs**, process **natural language data**, and build **interactive applications**.
